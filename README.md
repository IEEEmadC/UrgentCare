# UrgentCare

# DESCRIPTION OF THE APP
# Usefulness
The app will be used to the reduce high accident death rates resulting from delayed attendance to victims.

# Technical Approach
The app can be used by two types of users: the victim and the volunteer.
The volunteer registers and his details are stored in the database. 
The victim part can be used by the person involved in an accident or a nearby person at the scene in case the victim isn’t in position to use the phone due to a terrible accident. The person can send a text notification or an image notification with an image of the current scene, to volunteers.
The volunteers will view the notification and can reply with a message which is sent to the sender. The reply message will include the volunteers phone number which can be used to contact them. After the reply is sent, the volunteer is redirected to a Google maps screen with the location of the accident
The volunteers can in turn start up a group chat and be informed about the current scene of the accident. The volunteers who are at the scene can also send photos of the current scene, to the group.
The chat functionality will mainly enable volunteers to collaborate in attending to the person who has gotten the accident.
The person at the victim part is also able to view a list of registered volunteers and their phone numbers. He can also be able to view nearby volunteers and also nearby medical centers within 10km of their current location. This can the person on which volunteer or medical center to contact first.

# Tools used

Google Places API was used to locate the nearby medical centers 10km with the user’s current location
